So you want to host an Airbnb in NYC?

This project uses data from Airbnb in New York City (specifically Brooklyn and Manhattan).

- The cleaned data and math used for this project is in [this Excel file](https://github.com/Carlene/airbnb_capstone/blob/master/AB_NYC_2019_roomtype.xlsx).
- The code used to create the Postgres database and queries written to get the data necessary for my project is in [this text file](https://github.com/Carlene/airbnb_capstone/blob/master/airbnb_capstone.sql).
